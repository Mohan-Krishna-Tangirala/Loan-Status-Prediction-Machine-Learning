# Loan Status Prediction System

## Overview

This project implements a loan status prediction system using machine learning techniques, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. 
The goal is to predict whether a person is eligible for a loan based on various features such as income, marital status, education, and credit history. 
This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a machine learning project, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.


## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn


## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the process of building a loan status prediction system using machine learning. 
The Support Vector Machine algorithm effectively predicts loan eligibility based on various features
